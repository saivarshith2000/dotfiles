### Dotfiles
This repository contains all the dotfiles that I use across various machines.

### How it works
1. All the files in this repository all hard links to actual config files I use
2. When I change a config, I come back to this repo and push it
3. When I create a new config, I link to an appropriate file in this repo and push it
4. To use this repo, clone it and you can do cp/ln them to the correct directory on the local machine
5. That's it. Its not cool or fancy but it works and it works always :)
